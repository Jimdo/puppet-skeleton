Skeleton Puppet Module
======================

This is a testable Puppet module designed for you or your organization to fork
and modify appropriately. The module comes with everything you need to develop
infrastructure code with Puppet and feel confident about it. See file
`TESTING.md` to learn more.

(While you're encouraged to customize everything in this module to fit your
needs, I recommend keeping the `TESTING.md` file as-is.)

Testing
=======

Everything you need to know about testing this module is explained in
`TESTING.md`.
